# BT4222 Group 9 - Product Sales Rank Prediction (AY20/21 Sem 2)

Our project is focused on Amazon's product sales rank, which measures a product's performance compared to other products in a given category.

The project is divided into 3 stages:

1. Developing a classification model for Amazon reviews

Sentiment analysis is done on an Amazon reviews dataset, and we also developed our own classification model to categorise reviews into 'positive' or 'negative'. After which, we aggregated the dataset down into product metadata-level.

2. Developing a regression model for sales rank

By using the dataset developed from Stage 1, we employed different models to attempt to predict product sales rank.

3. Augmenting the dataset with online brand sentiment

To further enhance our analysis, we scraped tweets from Twitter, and news headlines from Google News, to better understand the brand sentiment, and determine if the addition of this information proves to be useful in predicting sales rank.
